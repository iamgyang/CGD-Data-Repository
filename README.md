This is a repository for Center for Global Development RAs.

It is meant as a way to share code with ourselves, as well as serve as a resource for the greater development community. 

Github is not really meant to be a dataset sharing community. 
So, we will be posting *links* to useful datasets, and will (hopefully) be keeping these links up to date.

The code is mostly written in STATA and R. 

There are 3 folders:
 - Background
 - Code
 - Data

Background: Anything related to being an RA, development, etc. (i.e. anything interesting that is not an R, STATA file, or a link to a data source)

This experiment could fail! And that's okay...
