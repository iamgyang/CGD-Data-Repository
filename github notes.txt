Hello all,

Tomorrow I will be giving an intro to using Github. 
No pressure to join--however, if you do join, please download Github beforehand, and create an account. 
I've also attached some of the notes related to tomorrow's discussion at the bottom of this email. 
IF you feel super competent in using Github, and would like to teach instead of me (I'm still relatively new), please message me. 
I will gladly pass the baton.

*** download github
git-scm.com/downloads

*** create account
github.com

Thanks!
George

*** Create a repository

	// Then 'Repositories'
	// Go through everything, and click the icon for add README

*** Then fill out this form: https://forms.gle/CGiWXHbeVoTDpbSJ9

*** Clone repository:
	// Go to main page of repository.
	// Click on "Code", and then copy the URL.

	// Create a folder in the desktop that is called "TESTING GITHUB"
	// Then, navigate using command line to that folder.
		cd.. goes up a few folders
		cd/ goes to the root folder
	// So, AFTER you've created this folder, navigate to it:
	// this may be different on your computer, but on mine, it's
		cd Users\user\Desktop\TESTING GITHUB
	// OR, just navigate to the folder in windows explorer and type cmd at the top

	// Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
	// e.g. will be different for you, but for me, it's
		git clone https://github.com/iamgyang/CGD-Data-Repository.git

// EDIT SOME THINGS (e.g. code file, README)
// Create a txt file and save it in the repository:
	// check status
		git status

// Reset the directory to be the repository folder
// this will differ based on what the name of your repository is

	cd CGD-Data-Repository 

// Now, make some edits on your computer.
// Tell it which files you want to add:

	git add README.md

// Check status (compare your directory to the last time you commited):
	git status

// Now, lock in your changes: 
	git commit -m "I changed the README.MD file"

// Sync with the online repository for everyone on your team

	git push

// Get 1 volunteer -- push something to my github repo

// Now, to get what everyone else just made, type in 

	git pull
