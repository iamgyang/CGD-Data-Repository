Hello all,

Tomorrow I will be giving an intro to using Github. 
No pressure to join--however, if you do join, please download Github beforehand, and create an account. 
I've also attached some of the notes related to tomorrow's discussion at the bottom of this email. 
IF you feel super competent in using Github, and would like to teach instead of me (I'm still relatively new), please message me. 
I will gladly pass the baton.

*** download github
git-scm.com/downloads

*** create account
github.com

Thanks!
George

	// Create a folder in the desktop that is called "TESTING GITHUB"
	// Then, navigate using command line to that folder.
		cd Desktop/TESTING GITHUB

	// Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
	// e.g.
		git clone https://github.com/iamgyang/CGD-Data-Repository.git

// Create a txt file and save it in the repository:
	
	newfile_janedoe.txt

// Reset the directory to be the repository folder
// this will differ based on what the name of your repository is

	cd CGD-Data-Repository 

// Now, make some edits on your computer.
// Tell it which files you want to add:
